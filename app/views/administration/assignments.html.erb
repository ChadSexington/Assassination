<h1>Administer Assignments</h1>
<br>
<div class="well">

<!-- 

The idea here is to create a page,
populate it with player names,
and offer checkboxes per player
in case someone is unavailable for a 
given round.

Once a "Create" button has been hit
it will invoke some algorithm (in 
assignment_controller.rb?) that will
create a bracket for the week. This
should take into account who their
previous target was.
